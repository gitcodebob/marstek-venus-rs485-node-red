## 🔧 Key Concepts

### PID Controller
The self-consumption strategy uses a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to automatically maintain near-zero grid power. Think of it as a smart thermostat for your energy flow.

**Learn more:** [PID Controller Theory](reference/pid-controller.md) | [Self-Consumption Strategy](strategies/self-consumption.md)

### Strategies
Different control algorithms optimized for different use cases (self-consumption, dynamic pricing, timed charging, etc.).

**Learn more:** [Strategy Overview](strategies/overview.md)

### Battery Prioritization
For multi-battery systems, determines which battery charges/discharges first, with automatic rotation to distribute wear evenly.

**Learn more:** [Battery Prioritization](advanced/battery-prioritization.md)

### Modbus RS485
Communication protocol used to control batteries. Requires hardware bridge (ESPHome device) between battery and Home Assistant.

**Learn more:** [Hardware Setup](getting-started/hardware-setup.md)

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Self-Consumption Strategy
- **Grid power tracking:** ±20-50W average (with proper tuning)
- **Response time:** 10-60 seconds to load changes
- **Battery cycles:** 0.5-1.5 per day (depending on solar/consumption)

### Dynamic Pricing Strategy
- **Savings:** €0.50-4.00 per day (depending on price volatility and battery size)
- **Battery cycles:** 0.5-2.0 per day
- **Automation:** Fully automatic daily planning
